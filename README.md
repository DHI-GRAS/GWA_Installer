# GWA Toolbox Installer <img src="https://github.com/DHI-GRAS/GWA_Installer/blob/master/GWA.ico" height="40">

This installer is part of The GWA toolbox developed under the GlobWetland Africa project. 

GlobWetland Africa (GWA) is a large Earth Observation application project funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) in partnership with
the African Team of the Ramsar convention on wetlands. The project is initiated to facilitate the exploitation of satellite observations
for the conservation, wise-use and effective management of wetlands in Africa and to provide African stakeholders with the necessary Earth
Observation (EO) methods and tools to better fulfil their commitments and obligations towards the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. 

It calls the installers of the various software components (OSGeo4W software, BEAM, Snap Toolbox etc.) in the appropriate order and takes
care of post-installation tasks such as file copying (e.g. of QGIS plugins) or changing settings.

This is not the complete  software package. The actual software can be downloaded (after registration) at www.globwetland-africa.org.
